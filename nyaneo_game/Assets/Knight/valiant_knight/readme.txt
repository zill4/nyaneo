//HOW TO USE THIS ASSET//
/////////////////////////

Hello! Thank you for downloading the Valiant Knight asset pack. Here are a few pointers to help you navigate and make sense of this zip file.

- In the root folder, you will find folders corresponding to each color style for the knight.

- In any of the style folders, you will find a folder named PNG. This folder contains the animation frames as individual PNGs. Each animation has its own folder.

- In the style folders, you will also find a folder named spritesheet. This folder contains the spritesheet for that style as well as a metadata file for parsing the spritesheet.

- The recommended frame duration is 0.75 seconds per frame (15 FPS).

- The attack animations each have two frames at the end that are intended to be a transition back to the idle animation. If you want to chain the attacks together into a combo, skip those frames.

Any questions?
Email me at contact@untiedgames.com and I'll try to answer as best I can!

-Will
