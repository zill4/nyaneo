//HOW TO USE THIS TILESET//
///////////////////////////

Hello, fellow game developer! Thank you for downloading the Northcastle Trail Remix tileset. Here are a few pointers to help you navigate and make sense of this zip file.

Tips:

- You can find all the pieces to put together your levels in the "pieces" folder.

- I've also included a sprite sheet in the "spritesheet" folder, along with two metadata files. (Pick the format you like)

- Many of the pieces are set up to align to a 16x16 grid. Remember this when you're putting it together!

- Due to the nature of the rock terrain pattern, there are a lot of terrain files. I could go in detail trying to explain specific rules as to how to put the terrain together, but here's my best advice: Just start placing terrain, and switch between patterns A and B as needed. You'll figure it out.

- You can help make sense of the labels using the following guide, which applies to all my tilesets.

File name definitions:
	- "terrain"			Part of the tileset's terrain. The player probably stands on this.
	- "left/right/top/bottom"	The left/right/top/bottom wall or edge of the terrain.
	- "center"			Context-specific. Usually means the middle of something.
	- "bg1", "bg2", etc.		Background. Higher number indicates further back.
	- "fg1", "fg2", etc.		Foreground. Higher number indicates further forwards.
	- "_1", "_2", "_3", etc.	A suffix with a number indicates there are multiple variants of this object.
	- "_f1", "_f2", "_f3", etc.	Suffixes with "f" and a number indicate a frame of an animation.
	- "A1", "B1", etc.		"A," "B," "C," and so on indicate different patterns, styles, or objects.
					The number following the letter indicates a variant.

- Don't know how to put something together? Take a look at the example/wallpaper image and it might be able to help you.

- Really curious how it was all made? Need some hints for layer ordering? Check out northcastle_trail_remix.psd. It's got it all.
