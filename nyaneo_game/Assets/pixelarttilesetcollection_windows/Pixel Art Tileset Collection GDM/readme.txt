Hello! Thank you for purchasing my Pixel Art Tileset Collection. Here are a few pointers to help you navigate and make sense of this zip file.

- Each tileset has its own folder.

- Most tileset folders have a PNG folder and a spritesheet folder.

- The PNG folder (sometimes labeled "pieces" or "assembled_parts", depending on how old the tileset is) contains all the pieces of the tileset as individual PNG files.

- The spritesheet folders contain the spritesheet for the selected tileset, and two choices of metadata format for reading the spritesheet. (Pick the format you like!)

- You can help make sense of the labels using the following guide, which applies to all my tilesets.

File name definitions:
	- "terrain"				Part of the tileset's terrain. The player probably stands on this.
	- "left/right/top/bottom"		The left/right/top/bottom wall or edge of the terrain.
	- "bg1", "bg2", etc.			Background. Higher number indicates further back.
	- "fg1", "fg2", etc.			Foreground. Higher number indicates further forwards.
	- "_A", "_B", "_C", etc.		A suffix with a letter indicates there are multiple variants of this object.
	- "frame0000", "frame0001", etc.	Filenames like this indicate an animation.
	- "2x2", "4x4", etc.			Indicates the size of this object, in tiles.

- Pretty much every object and tile is a size multiple of 8x8 or 16x16 pixels. They're made to stick to an 8x8 or 16x16 grid, but you don't necessarily have to stick to a grid if you don't want to.

- Be sure to check out the included example images to see how to put the tilesets together.
